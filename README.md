# ChessMaker
Chess Maker is a customizable chess game that allows you to create animated pieces, add sounds, and save settings. But the creator wishes someone to turn it into a website where the art of the pieces is marketable. He also suggests adding tournaments and art competitions. Settings are saved by copying a generated text. 

The animations are:
The images can be in the recommended format (.gif).

1) common type which will always be seen in the game.
it has no sound.
2) type of attack, 2 sec, and it is for when the piece attacks.
you can put a 2 sec sound.
3) type of death, 2 sec, and it is for when the character dies.
You can put a 2-second sound.

You can customize the squares on the board and the sounds of the game, such as the check sound, the game reset sound, the coronation sound, and the checkmate sound. And finally, to complete a specific style, you can change the entire color range of the game environment. All the configuration can be saved by copying and saving the generated text in a notepad, so that you can later load it.

Here I leave you the html code, in text, what you have to do is put the code in a notepad and change the .txt extension to .html and double-click to open in a browser of your choice!! and you're ready to edit it to your liking.

I'm not giving you the code for the save images because I'm not the owner of that art, and I only used and edited it for testing.

To all chess lovers, build your boards and your art, the only condition I put on your free use is that you give me the privilege of seeing and appreciating your art for Chess Maker!
